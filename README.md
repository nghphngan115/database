# Tay Nguyen Food Database Design
## Project Overview
This project involves designing a comprehensive stimulated database for Tay Nguyen Food. The database is intended to manage various aspects of the business, including customer management, sales, inventory, and delivery, with a focus on efficiency and accuracy.
## Details
The project starts with a business survey that provides an overview of Tay Nguyen Foodâ€™s mission, business model, and key operations. It then moves into the design of an entity-relationship model, defining entities, attributes, and their relationships. The logical and physical database designs are detailed, including the relational schema and data types. SQL scripts are provided to create and set up the database on MySQL Server, along with sample data for testing. Finally, a set of SQL queries is included to manage and analyze various business functions like customer management, sales tracking, delivery logistics, inventory control, and financial operations.
